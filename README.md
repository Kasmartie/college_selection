This Android application has the sole purpose of enabling Students, Institutions and Relevant admission bodies(KUCCPs in this case) have an efficient 
time when students are joining highere levels of learning.

Altghough mainly targeted to Universities and colleges in the first testing stages, this application has an imense potential and can easily be used
as an effective tool for any level of learning in any country.Licence of it's use or any other application that it 

As a developer, I have decided to make this project open especially during the developmental stages and everyone can contribute towards it's progress.
Such contributions can be in form of codes or financial support and all shall go along way of imense appreciation.

I will have to admit, that making a web app was never planned. But being a student, I realized that Java was not an alternative especially if I had to program on a cheap laptop or borrow laptop frequently from a friend in name of making an application that will one day revolutionize the college admission system. 

My deccision to make a web app instead of a native app was done after long research and clear advice on why Java was not just an option for me. Although am a great fun of Java and all the core android related Java libraries, calculation upfront was just worth it.

As am beginning this project, my plan upfront is to use Javascript and it's JQUERY library on the UI and use Python stack at the back end. I am an experienced web developer and Machine learning engineer, but it's worth noting that android application development with web standards was just the ueasy bit.

The following languages will be used in developing this android application. Remember that am not including core libraries and frameworks  that helps bridge the gap between Mobile and Web applications. If that is what you want, reach me through my contacts down below.

1.Python - Main backend stack.(Python Django and Flask used instead of Native Python)
2.JavaScript - Main Front end Stack.
3.HTML, CSS, JQuery - Designing user interfaces.

There are alot of decisions that I have made to make this projects have a smooth progress and be shown out to the world for it's economic feasibility. Sometimes, my eyes may not be so keen after sleepless nights of integrating even the most intricate of all codes. For that, if you experience any problem or bug while using this application, please reach out to me so that I may fix it.
